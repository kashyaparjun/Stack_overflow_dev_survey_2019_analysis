## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Using the Stack overflow developer survey 2019 data, I wanted to derive the following business understanding questions:

1. Does open source development help you increase your income?
2. Does your undergrad major affect youe income?
3. What are the languages of choice for 2020?
4. Does Location, Open source contribution and dependents influence income?
5. Does years of coding experience influence salary?
6. What are the desired platforms for 2020?
7. What are the desired databases for 2020?
8. Which was the most used eidtor of 2019?

With the above questions, I am trying to derive inferences about the technologies that developers would use in 2020.
Also, using the above questions, budding developers can set goals and aspirations for their careers.
